        Free Practice and Qualifying
       </h3>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="8b78" name="8b78">
        Free Practice was a rough ride for Ollie Bearman. His weekend started on the wrong foot as he crashed out in FP1, couldn’t participate in FP2 and ended FP3 in the gravel. It was a nightmare start for the rookie and his struggles only continued into qualifying with a gearbox making the weekend worse.
       </p>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7c06" name="7c06">
        Qualifying, on the other hand, delivered plenty of excitement. It gave us the first glimpse of which teams had pace and how tight the field might be and it didn’t disappoint.
       </p>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="de53" name="de53">
        Liam Lawson in the RedBull had a disastrous outing, failing to make it past Q1. Joining Lawson in the Q1 exits were Bearman, Esteban Ocon, Kimi Antonelli, and Nico Hülkenberg. On the happier note, Gabriel Bortoleto was able to clutch it and to advance into Q2.
       </p>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1514" name="1514">
        In Q2, Bortoleto continued to shine alongside strong efforts from Jack Doohan and Isack Hadjar. Hadjar, in particular, stood out by taking P11, the best result among the rookies.
       </p>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="e2c0" name="e2c0">
        Q3 was where McLaren truly stamped their authority, locking out the front row with Lando Norris securing pole and Oscar Piastri in second. Max Verstappen’s stellar performance landed him third, while George Russell secured a solid P4. Yuki Tsunoda delivered an incredible P5 in an inferior car, outqualifying Lawson and showcasing his class. The Williams drivers also made waves, with Alex Albon in P6 and Carlos Sainz in P10, an impressive achievement for the team to have both cars in the top 10. Meanwhile, Ferrari remained underwhelming, with Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton finishing in P7 and P8.

        What a spectacular way to kick off the season! The race had everything. Multiple safety cars, numerous DNFs, unpredictable rain, and wild strategies. It was pure chaos and excitement from start to finish!

        Formation Lap Chaos
       </h4>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="7876" name="7876">
        During the formation lap,
        <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">
         Isack Hadjar
        </strong>
        spun out and crashed. It’s genuinely heartbreaking for the rookie, especially as this was his first race. It seems like he got on the throttle too aggressively, causing too much torque and resulting in a spin. A classic rookie error, but in such challenging conditions there’s no one to blame. Huge respect to
        <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">
         Anthony Hamilton
        </strong>
        , Lewis Hamilton’s father, for comforting Hadjar after the crash. That was an absolute class act, tears in my eyes on a Sunday morning.
       </p>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="22fd" name="22fd">
        The crash led to an aborted start. A new formation lap followed shortly after, and soon enough, we were ready to go racing.

        The “Start”
       </h4>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="e12b" name="e12b">
        As the lights went green, it was full throttle. Lando Norris impressively kept the lead by the first corner, but Oscar Piastri, starting from P2, wasn’t as lucky. Max Verstappen quickly overtook him within seconds.
       </p>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="99ab" name="99ab">
        Interestingly, I feel if the track was dry, Max might have claimed P1 by the end of Turn 1. Piastri struggled with a poor start and the rain made late braking tricky for Verstappen. Still, Piastri appeared to have trouble keeping the car stable due to the wet conditions and the slippery white paint lines which proved problematic for many drivers.
       </p>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c88e" name="c88e">
        Just as the race began, chaos returned. Jack Doohan in the Alpine and Carlos Sainz in the Williams spun and crashed out separately, leading to their early exits. A tough blow for rookie Doohan and devastating for Sainz in his debut race with Williams.
       </p>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="7aac" name="7aac">
        After just one lap of racing, the safety car came out, and we resumed racing on Lap 8.

        The McLaren Drama Continues
       </h4>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="ddc0" name="ddc0">
        On lap 19, Max Verstappen in P2 went wide and lost his position to Piastri. From there, his race began to unravel, with a 16-second gap forming between him and the second-place driver before another safety car. The McLarens extended their lead.
       </p>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="c96d" name="c96d">
        However, team orders quickly caused controversy. Piastri, closing the gap to Lando, was told to hold his position despite being just 0.5 seconds behind. Even more frustratingly, once the gap widened to over 2 seconds, the team told him he was free to race. The inconsistency and lack of trust in their driver were baffling. It’s ridiculous to hold a driver back in their home race that too on the first race of the season when they have a genuine shot at challenging for the lead.

        Rookie Performances
       </h4>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="eabf" name="eabf">
        Andrea Kimi Antonelli drove like a star in this race. Starting with some fantastic early overtakes, he crossed the line in P4. It was an exceptional performance for the rookie, showcasing his raw talent. After a disappointing qualifying session where he finished P16, this result will feel like a huge win for him. Brilliant work from the young star!
       </p>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="999c" name="999c">
        Ollie Bearman, despite challenging practice and qualifying sessions, stayed consistent and avoided crashes in such tricky conditions. His performance was remarkable given Haas’s poor strategies, proving his immense potential.
       </p>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d68f" name="d68f">
        Liam Lawson had a tough race due to Red Bull’s strategic missteps. Staying out too long on dry tires in wet conditions cost him dearly, leading to a spin and eventual crash. Lawson remains an interesting figure as we are still waiting to see his full potential in the Red Bull car. He needs to perform quickly or face the fear of being axed.
       </p>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9d6d" name="9d6d">
        Along with Lawson Bortoleto also spun out and crashed ending his debut race.
       </p>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="3837" name="3837">
        Jack Doohan, unfortunately, spun out and crashed early, adding to the rookie woes. Isack Hadjar’s formation lap incident only compounded the struggles for the new drivers, with four rookies not making it to the finish line.

        Alonso’s Crash and Strategic Chaos
       </h4>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="3b6e" name="3b6e">
        Fernando Alonso brought more drama when he crashed on Lap 34. A high-speed corner with gravel and water caught him out, sending him spinning into the barriers. With another safety car in play, teams faced a dilemma: gamble on dry tires or stick with intermediates. Heavy rain was forecasted around Lap 45, making it a high-stakes decision.

        Haas made a baffling choice. They stayed out on intermediates, only to pit for dry tires after being instructed to unlap themselves. The strategy left Ollie Bearman stuck in the lapped queue again, further hurting his chances. Ironically, their gamble could have worked if they had committed.
       </p>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="798f" name="798f">
        When the rain poured down, it caused havoc. Piastri spun out, losing second place at his home GP. An absolute loss for him but he was still able to finish in P9 so all was not lost. Verstappen faced similar issues, staying out on dry tires in wet conditions, costing him valuable time.

       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing" id="3d89" name="3d89">
        Alex Albon was one of the standout performers, finishing P5 for Williams. Seeing him fight at the sharp end of the grid was thrilling. This year, Albon has serious competition from teammate Carlos Sainz, which seems to be pushing him to deliver his best. Last year, his seat was never in doubt against Logan Sargeant, but with Sainz now in the mix, Albon appears to be rising to the challenge. If he keeps this up, both he and Williams will have an exciting season ahead.

       </h4>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing" id="337a" name="337a">
        For the Racing Bulls, it was a race to forget. Yuki Tsunoda started P5 and finished P12. The poor result can be attributed to strategic missteps. Despite driving excellently throughout the race, their decisions off-track cost them dearly. It’s a shame, as they could have scored some good points.

        Australia continues to haunt Haas. Poor qualifying, a challenging race, and questionable strategies all added up to a disappointing outing. Despite this, the drivers deserve praise for their performances. Haas has a lot to work on.

        A Frustrating Start for Ferrari
       </h4>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing" id="4722" name="4722">
        Ferrari’s race ended with finishes in P8 and P10, hardly what they hoped for. While there’s still a long season ahead, they will need to regroup and address the issues if they want to fight for top positions consistently.

        P7 for Nico Hülkenberg in the Sauber, what a drive! The veteran showcased his immense talent, securing more points for the team in one race than they managed throughout 2022. It’s an exciting start, and Hülkenberg’s performance will surely give Sauber plenty to look forward to this season.

        George Russell: The Opportunist
       </h4>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing" id="b31e" name="b31e">
        George Russell has earned a reputation for waiting patiently and capitalizing on others’ mistakes, and today was no different. During Austria 2024, Max and Lando’s battle gifted him the win. This time, he started 4th and had to fight fiercely against strong contenders like Alex Albon and Yuki Tsunoda. Despite the chaos, Russell delivered a stellar drive, staying consistent and emerging with a well-earned podium finish.

        The Final Two Laps: A Thrilling Finish
       </h4>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="a56f" name="a56f">
        In the last two laps, Verstappen was right on Lando’s tail with DRS. It was pure racing as Verstappen pushed to take the lead. Despite the pressure, Lando kept his calm, holding on to win the Australian GP. It was nice to see him not crack, especially in such unpredictable conditions.
       </p>
       <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="30c9" name="30c9">
        As a Max fan, it was bittersweet to see him miss out, but the competition was exhilarating. Verstappen was incredible throughout the race, showcasing his skill despite not having the fastest car. His P2 finish is a testament to his talent.
